MayhamJam
=========

Mayham Jam is a game jam where we are given 72 hours to create a game. The Portland Indi Game Squad put on the event at Urban Ariship.

We made a city destruction simulator where you are a bit green monster that can destroy buildings and stomp people. I worked along 5 others to put a video game with in the time limit. I programmed and managed the team.
